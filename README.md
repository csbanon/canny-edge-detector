## Description

Canny Edge Detector is an implementation of the edge detection method defined by John Canny in 1986. This is done by performing the following computational steps:

1. Perform Gaussian smoothing on the image.
2. Compute the gradient magnitude and orientation using derivative masks.
3. Perform non-maximum suppression.
4. Perform hysteresis thresholding.
